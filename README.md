# topic-modelling-covid19-tweets
"The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm was employed to cluster and identify various themes in Covid-19-associated tweets. The COV19Tweets Dataset from IEEE Data Port, containing the IDs of Covid-19 related tweets, was used. The Hydrator tool was utilized to retrieve the raw reviews from Twitter based on the provided tweet IDs. Furthermore, an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to analyze the tweets from multiple perspectives, including sentiment classification, frequently mentioned words, and commonly used hashtags. The pyLDAvis library was used for interactive visualization of the LDA topic model, facilitating topic interpretation. Finally, an interactive dashboard was created using Plotly to display the analysis results.
